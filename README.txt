This program takes in 3 arguments or no arguments. If 3 arguments are entered, the first one will be the duration that the program executes. The 2nd argument must be either 1 or 60, and will be how often the current time is printed. The last argument will be when an alarm is printed, and must be less than the first argument. If no arguments are given, the default values are used (25, 1, 17). 

To compile this program, do 'make'. And then to run the program, do 'mot' followed by either 3 arguments or none. To clean this program, do 'make clean'. 

Run the program from Said Mohamed's edoras account.
